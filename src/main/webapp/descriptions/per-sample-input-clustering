Each RNAseq sample's compositionally biased proteins are clustered at 95% identity to reduce redundancy using

smaller dataset and thus speed the process at key bottlenecks.

The data table has the per-sample breakdown of the clustering process: number of compositionally biased
sequences per RNAseq sample at the previous step, and the resulting number of cluster representatives chosen
to proceed to the next step. Typically clustering halves the amount of data for the next step. Although some
allelic variation may be lost, we consider this recoverable at a later date. The spreadsheet also contains the
sample identification information. Only samples which are processed by MAAB appear in this spreadsheet.
