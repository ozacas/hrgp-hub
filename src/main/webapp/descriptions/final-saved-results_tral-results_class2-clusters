<h3>Putative class 2 orthologs from cpHMM analysis</h3>

<p>
Extending the above cpHMM analysis, we apply these significant repeats to
all class 2 extensins. The aim is to identify related repeat architectures
and putative orthologs. This is done by the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>construct cpHMMs for each significant repeat</li>
    <li>apply each cpHMM using hmmsearch, to the set of MAAB class 2 extensins</li>
    <li>reject all models (ie. cpHMMs) which produce more than 200 hits: poor specificity</li>
    <li>align hits, using muscle, for each cpHMM including the protein sequence which gave the repeat used to build the cpHMM</li>
    <li>save only those alignments between 2 and 50 hits, and a corresponding summary of each model and the clades/orders/families hit by the cpHMM</li>
</ol>

<p>
A histogram of cpHMM hits is also available below, but this only displays those models with less than
200 hits.
