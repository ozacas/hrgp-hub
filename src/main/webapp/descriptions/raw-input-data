The data at this step, represents the input given to MAAB. It comprises only those proteins
which are at least 100AA, compositionally biased (%PAST/%PSKY/%PVYK >= 45), at least 10% proline,
from all assembled 1KP samples, for each assembler k-mer (39,49,59 and 69) used. Thus a given protein may be reported in several k-mers.

A <a href="screen_hrgp.pl">BioPerl script is provided</a> to scan the translated ORFs found in each transcriptome 
an identify those sequences which pass the above criteria. This is the script which creates the data tables below.

<p>
The data is provided in two formats: CSV (gzip'ed) and <a href="http://www.knime.org">KNIME</a> .table format.
But they are very large files and will take some time to download.
