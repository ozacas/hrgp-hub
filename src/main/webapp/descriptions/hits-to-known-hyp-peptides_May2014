This pipeline step does no filtering, but does report those proteins which contain peptides
published in the literature as containing hydroxyproline. The literature search used as well as
matching proteins are available below. A large number of proteins have no hit, suggesting our
existing knowledge of hydroxyproline-containing peptides is inadequate.
