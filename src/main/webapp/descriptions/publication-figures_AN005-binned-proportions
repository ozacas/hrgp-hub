<h3>Proportional motif coverage (binned)</h3>

<p>
Again, several variants of this analysis are available, depending on your requirements:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>FigureA: plots the %proline coverage of proteins in each HRGP class and 1KP taxonomic clade. Idea
is to investigate shifts during evolution in potential hydroxylation sites</li>
    <li>FigureB: plots the %coverage of recognised AGP/Extensin and PRP motifs by HRGP class and taxonomic clade</li>
    <li>FigureC: although not officially regarded as AGP motifs, some AGP-like glycomotifs are often observed. We report
the % of AGP-like motifs, as a percentage coverage of total protein, by HRGP class and 1kp clade. AGP like motifs are 
defined by the regular expression: <tt>[IRKL]P{1,3}</tt></li>
</ol>
