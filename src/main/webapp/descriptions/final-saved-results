these data files are the final results produced by MAAB. They are large spreadsheets with lots of columns. For ease of
use we have split them into two halves:

<ol>
    <li>SA001: angiosperms and higher plants</li>
    <li>SA002: algae/bryophytes</li>
    <li>SA003: a per-sample and per-HRGP-class count of the results of the MAAB May2014 classifier</li>
</ol>
