<h3>Class 3 (PRP) TRAL analysis</h3>

<p>
A similar analysis to the Class 2 TRAL analysis (above), but this time performed
on the modest collection of non-chimeric PRPs identified by MAAB. We wished to validate
whether MA005 contained some putative PRPs, but which were not classified as class 3 due
to missing N-terminal sequence.
