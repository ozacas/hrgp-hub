<h3>May2014 classification results</h3>

<p>
The May2014 classifier will fail to classify proteins if the metrics are too close to call. This does happen, rarely, and
such proteins are reported below:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>FC001: proteins which the classifier failed on. Subsequent classifiers, which are not used for the manuscript, attempted to address the issues raised.</li>
    <li>FC002: classification results for each HRGP class with a total count of proteins in each class</li>
</ol>
