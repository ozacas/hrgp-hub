Some of the compositionally biased proteins which have survived processing so far, will contain
recognised PFAM domains. Not all such chimeric proteins will have made it thus far, due to the domain
not being compositionally biased, thus causing the overall protein to fail earlier tests. However, those that
do survive are reported here.
