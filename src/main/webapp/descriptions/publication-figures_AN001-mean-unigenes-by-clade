<h3>Mean unigenes by clade</h3>

<p>
This plot, shows mean unigenes, as accepted by MAAB per 1KP taxonomic clade. There are several variants to cover
varying needs:
</p>
<li>figure3: shows the mean unigenes per clade. Except for commenlinids which are shown at the order level, to
aid in showing loss of extensins in grasses. Missing samples eg. due to contaminants or no hits are treated as zero
with the mean and SD computed accordingly. Note that error bars show standard deviation for clade/order.</li>
<li>figure3b: shows only those genes, which are not part of worrisome contaminated samples. The mean and SD are computed
from all samples of a given clade, even those which had no hits in MAAB eg. due to tissue type or assembly detection issues</li>
<li>figure3c: same as figure3b but with monocots removed. Only HRGP classes 1 thru 4 are shown</li>
