<h3>Mean unigenes by clade</h3>

<p>
This plot, shows mean unigenes, as accepted by MAAB per 1KP taxonomic clade. There are several variants to cover
varying needs:
</p>
<li>figure3: shows only those genes, which are not part of worrisome contaminated samples. The mean and SD are computed
from samples with hits <b>only</b></li>
<li>figure3b: shows only those genes, which are not part of worrisome contaminated samples. The mean and SD are computed
from all samples of a given clade, even those which had no hits in MAAB eg. due to tissue type or assembly detection issues</li>
<li>figure3c: TODO...</li>
