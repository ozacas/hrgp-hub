<!-- <h3>Removal of hits from worrisome contaminated samples</h3> -->

<p>
The OneKP consortium has published a list of samples which reportedly contaminants. We report hits from only those
samples without a worrisome contaminant, so any identified HRGPs from approximately 100 samples 
are removed as described by the spreadsheets below. At a future date, we plan to use phylogenetic analysis
to estimate the likelihood of a HRGP introduced from a contaminant and remove in a more refined and selective, fashion.
