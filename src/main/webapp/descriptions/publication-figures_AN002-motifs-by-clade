<h3>Per taxonomic clade motif distribution</h3>

<p>
The HRGP family contains major motif classes: AGP glycomotifs (<tt>[STAVPG]P</tt>), cross linking (often including
tyrosine motifs) and extensin SerPro (<tt>SP{3-5}</tt>) motifs. These plots display the frequency of each motif by HRGP class
and 1KP taxonomic clade, with separate plots for each combination. The horizontal axis displays the motifs
searched for in identified proteins, with the vertical axis displaying the percentage of that motif found.
