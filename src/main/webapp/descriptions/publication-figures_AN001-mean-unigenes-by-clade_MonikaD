<h3>Mean unigenes by clade (MonikaD variant)</h3>

<p>
Monika wanted to investigate a variant of figure3 plots: separate figures for each HRGP class and
without commelinids (monocot) orders expanded. Each plot has missing samples treated as zero eg. due to no hits from MAAB
or contaminantion as zero. With the mean and SD computed accordingly.
