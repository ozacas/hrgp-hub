<h3>Classifying proteins into HRGP classes (MAAB)</h3>

<p>
This pipeline step classifies surviving proteins from earlier processing into exactly one of 24 HRGP
classes. Several versions of the classifier exist: only the May2014 classifier is published here. The
results for all classifiers are available from the workflow download.

<p>
Several datasets are available at this pipeline step:
<ol>
    <li>FC003:reports the number of proteins in each class, by each RNA-seq sample</li>
    <li>MA001:samples seen by MAAB with hits</li>
    <li>MA005: proteins which failed to produce a positive SignalP prediction. This can be caused
by partial sequence or misprediction of the protein sequence and is provided as a resource for blast for
checking putative orthologs against a larger set.</li>
</ol>
