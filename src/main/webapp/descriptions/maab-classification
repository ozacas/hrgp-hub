<h3>Classifying proteins into HRGP classes (MAAB)</h3>

<p>
This pipeline step classifies surviving proteins from earlier processing into exactly one of 24 HRGP
classes. Several versions of the classifier exist: only the May2014 classifier is published here. The
results for all classifiers are available from the workflows.
