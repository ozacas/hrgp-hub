<h3>Results of clustering analyses</h3>

<p>
Although we provide these results, we consider them to be unsuccessful at categorising a large dataset into
smaller, more manageable pieces. The results are ok at small evolutionary distance eg. family-level but fail at larger evolutionary timescales.
Using these results is <b>not recommended</b> for all but the most constrained evolutionary analyses.

Four separate analyses are provided:
<ol>
    <li>CA001: examination of class 24 MAAB results showed prp-like results. this analysis tries to examine this further by
extracting members of class 24 with at least 15% coverage of PRP motifs like: <tt>P[QDEKPI]P[QDEKPI]</tt>, <tt>PP[QDEKPI]P[QDEKPI]</tt>.
Actually, this is not really a clustering, but it doesnt really belong anywhere else </tt>;-)</tt></li>

    <li>CA002: using cdhit (@80% identity) extract those clusters which have two or more families and align each cluster using muscle</li>
    <li>CA003: using cdhit to cluster MAAB class 1 identifications at 70% identity. Clusters which cross two or more taxonomic families
are aligned with muscle and saved. Summary results of the clustering process also. Other clusters ie. clusters of sequences which
are in one family only are not reported.</li>
    <li>CA004: we clustered using usearch at identity ranges from 50% to 70% in steps of 5%. Clusters are only aligned and reported if they
meet the following criteria: five or more sequences in the cluster. All such clusters are aligned (with <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> controls)
and reported. Small clusters are not reported.
</li>
